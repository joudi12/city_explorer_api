# Project Name

**Author**: joudi awameh
**Version**: 1.0.2 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
## Today, you will begin building an API server, which will provide data for the City Explorer Application, allowing a user to search for a location, present a Map, as well as interesting information about the area, all using data from APIs that your server will fetch and manage.
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
1. Repository Set Up you have to be shure to make to set up with data directory and instull the express and dotenv and cors 
2. then Create a route with a method of `get` and a path of `/weather`. The callback should use the provided JSON data.and same for weather
3. A constructor function will ensure that each object is created according to the same format when the server receives data. Ensure your code base uses a constructor function for this resource.
4. Using each weather object of the result, return an array of objects for each day of the response which contains the necessary information for correct client rendering. See the sample response.
5. Deploy your updated server code to Heroku.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
we use libraries  express and dotenv and cors
we use language In This app we use JavaScript
## Change Log
10-25-2020 4:48pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource.
10-25-2020 8:00pm - fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the weather services.
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource.
